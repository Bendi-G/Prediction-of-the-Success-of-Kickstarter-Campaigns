# Prediction-of-the-Success-of-Kickstarter-Campaigns
The goal of this project is to build a classifier to predict whether a project will be successfully funded or not. 
If you have a project that you would like to post on Kickstarter now, can you predict whether it will be successfully funded or not? Looking into the dataset, what useful information can you extract from it, which variables are informative for your prediction and can you interpret the model?
